# White Wine Classification
Can we use the physicochemical properties of wine to objectively predict whether the quality of a future unknown wine will be bad, normal, or good? Being able to answer this question may lead to insights on how we can improve the efficiency and accuracy of both the wine production and certification process. This project uses caret in R to train a classification model to predict the quality of wine.
